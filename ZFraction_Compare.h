/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is the Header of the class FracCompare, this is what handles the generating and checking 
input of the comparing 2 fractions questions.It will be sent pins in its Creator and Send back if the 
used was correct in the destructor. It will also need to be given the current diffculty count, but will
have all the rules for diffculty stored inside of its self.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the diffculty counter will be a 2x1 array that stores
Diffuculties of fractions (P)
  will be given as either 1 2 or 3 with (easy, medium, hard)
And the versus level (V)
 ranges from 1-6 with 
 1 Numerical vs Numerical
 2 Numerical vs Square
 3 Numerical vs Circle
 4 Square vs Square
 5 Circle vs Circle
 6 Cricle vs Square
EX: diffculty of {1,3} gives an easy numerical vs circle problem
EX: diffculty of {2,6} gives an Medium Circle vs Square problem

the general formula for the names of the functions that call these diffrent diffculties is
dispDiff_P_V(); -- these functions dont require any inputs
